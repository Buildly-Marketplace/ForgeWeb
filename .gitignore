# ForgeWeb .gitignore
# This file tells Git which files NOT to track in the ForgeWeb submodule

# ==========================================
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE
# ==========================================
# ForgeWeb is designed to be used as a Git submodule.
# User website files (index.html, articles/, assets/) are saved to the PARENT directory,
# NOT inside ForgeWeb. Only admin tools and templates are in this repository.

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Do not deploy these)

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock
#poetry.toml

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.
#   https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/project/#working-with-version-control
#pdm.lock
#pdm.toml
.pdm-python
.pdm-build/

# pixi
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pixi.lock in version control.
#pixi.lock
#   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
#   in the .venv directory. It is recommended not to include this directory in version control.
.pixi

#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#.idea/

# Abstra
# Abstra is an AI-powered process automation framework.
# Ignore directories containing user credentials, local state, and settings.

# Visual Studio Code
#  Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore 
#  that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#  you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
# .vscode/

# Cursor

# ==========================================
# OPTIONAL: Keep Admin Completely Local
# ==========================================
# Uncomment these lines if you want to exclude
# admin interface from Git (keep it local only):
#
# admin/
# templates/
# start.sh
# start.bat
# setup-dev.sh

# ==========================================
# WHAT GETS DEPLOYED (These ARE tracked)
# ==========================================
# The following files/folders WILL be deployed to GitHub Pages:
# - *.html (all HTML files in root directory)
# - assets/ (CSS, images, JavaScript)
# - articles/ or blog/ (your blog posts)
# - Any other folders you create for content
# - 404.html (custom error page)
# - CNAME (if using custom domain)
#
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for complete deployment guide
